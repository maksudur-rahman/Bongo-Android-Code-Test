# Bongo-Android-Code-Test

## This is a test for Bongo Android Developer position. Here I have solved these three problems, given below: 


## 1) 
Write a function that detects if two strings are anagram e.g. ‘bleat’ and ‘table’
are anagrams but ‘eat’ and ‘tar’ are not.


## 2) 
Explain the design pattern used in following:
```java
interface Vehicle {
int set_num_of_wheels()
int set_num_of_passengers()
boolean has_gas()
}
```
a) Explain how you can use the pattern to create car and plane class?

b) Use a different design pattern for this solution.


## 3) 
Write a video player application with ‘Play’, ‘Forward’, ‘Rewind’ functionalities. Please
write pseudocode for this program and explain the design pattern you will use to
develop these three functionalities.
